My name is Sindhu and I am currently pursuing my PhD at National University of Singapore. My research focus is on developing data-driven methods for better user comfort and energy savings in office buildings. 
This website mostly contains blog posts on R packages and specific use-cases, there may be bits of Python slithering in occasionally. You can also find a summary and code of my research and personal projects. 

I write another blog that is more broader in scope and covers things I find interesting related to data science. If you don't mind the randomness, you can visit [there](https://shettysindhu63.github.io/myblog/).
