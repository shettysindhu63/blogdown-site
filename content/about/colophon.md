The site is built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//gohugo.io">Hugo</a>â€”a static site generator made with Go and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> - an open-source R package to generate static websites. The site is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme">cocoa</a> theme. The posts are written in R Markdown.

The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.
